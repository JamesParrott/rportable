# R Portable Launcher
R Portable v3.2.3 packaged for PyPi.  

This library is intended for internal use only by sdna_plus, but 
let me know if you have other uses for it.

The wheel contains the R Portable code (version 3.2.3) bundled with sDNA,
but all the R Portable installers are available 
from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/files/.
